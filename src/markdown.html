DISSIMILARITY=ABSDIFF NEXTBEST = altclus SILHOUETTE = sil.
</code></pre>

<p>This command requires the data in memory and takes time that is proportional
to the square of the number of cases.  With larger datasets, you may want to carry
this analysis out on a random sample of the data.</p>

<p><strong>CLUSTER</strong> specifies the variable containing the cluster number for each case.
Gaps in the numbering, such as might occur if the cluster results are sampled,
are treated as clusters of size 0.</p>

<p><strong>VARIABLES</strong> lists the variables to be used for calculating silhouettes.  These would
normally be the variables used to compute the clustering, but this is not required.</p>

<p><strong>DISSIMILARITY</strong> specifies the function used to calculate the distance between cases.</p>

<ul>
<li>EUCLID is standard Euclidean distance.</li>
<li>ABSDIFF is the sum of the absolute values of the variable differences.</li>
<li>MINKOWSKI is the pth root of the sum of the pth power of the absolute differences.</li>
<li>GOWER distinguishes variables according to the measurement level.  Scale variables
are measured by absolute difference with each difference divided by the variable
range.  Ordinal variables are renumbered so that the
values range from 1 to M, where M is the number of distinct values and then treated
as scale.  Nominal variable differences are 0 or 1 according to whether the values are
equal or not.</li>
<li>MAXIMUM is the maximum variable difference.  It is never rescaled, but the OMIT
setting is honored.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NEXTBEST</strong> and <strong>SILHOUETTE</strong> specify variables for the casewise output.
The NEXTBEST variable holds the number of the next best cluster.
The SILHOUETTE variable holds the silhouette statistics.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>RENUMBERORDINAL</strong> causes ordinal variables to be recoded as above.  It is always
used for GOWER, but it can be used with any measure.</p>

<p><strong>VARWEIGHTS</strong> can specify weights for each of the clustering variables.  If used,
each variable difference is multiplied by the corresponding weight.  As many weights
must be specified as there are clustering variables.</p>

<p><strong>MISSING</strong> specifies how missing values are handled in case comparisions.  If a variable&#39;s
contribution to the measure cannot be computed because either case has a missing value,
there are three choices.  </p>

<ul>
<li>RESCALE causes the measure to be scaled up in proportion to the number 
of contributions that are missing.<br/></li>
<li>IGNORE causes the measure to be used without any adjustment (as long as 
at least one variable contributes).<br/></li>
<li>OMIT causes the case to be omitted from the calculations if any variable&#39;s contribution
cannot be computed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

<p><strong>HISTOGRAM</strong> specifies whether a histogram of silhouette scores for each cluster
is produced.  By default, the histograms are panelled horizontally.  </p>

<p><strong>ORIENTATION</strong> = VERTICAL causes the histograms to be stacked.  Since all the
histograms appear on one row, VERTICAL may be needed if there are many clusters.</p>

<p><strong>THREEDBAR</strong> = YES produces a 3-d bar chart showing the average silhouette value by
assigned cluster and the next best clusters.</p>

<p><strong>THREEDCOUNTS</strong> produces a 3-d bar chart showing for each assigned cluster
the percentage distribution of next best clusters.</p>
